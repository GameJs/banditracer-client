Quick start
============

Create `javascript/settings.js` by copying `javascript/settings-example.js'
(no change to file necessary for single player).

Open `index.html` with Firefox or Safar (other browsers can only play the game
if this directory is served via http://).

Or: Install banditracer-client with RingoJs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

   $ ringo-admin install domasx2/banditracer-client
   $ ringo-admin install hns/stick

Start the banditracer-client webserver:

    ringo -e "require('banditracer-client').startUp()"

Access the game at: <http://localhost:8080/>

Pack JS files
===============================

To improve the loading behaviour, pack all Js files into one and only load
that one. See gamejs/docs/deployment for more info.

    gamejs/wrap-directory.sh ../banditracer-client/javascript/

...then fix banditracer's index.html to use the single, big file
(read gamejs/docs/deployment for more info).

Map Editor
===============

requires:

  * python 2.5+
  * wxPython
  * PIL
  * simple json

    $ python editor.py

You can select objects with left mouse button and delete them with
delete key, use mousewheel to rotate props / car starting positions
before placing them. Tiles are not rotatable.

Your own dedicated multiplayer server
=======================================
