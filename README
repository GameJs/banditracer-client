Quick start
============

 * create `javascript/settings.js` (use `javascript/settings-example.js' as template)
 * open `index.html` with firefox/safari (serve over http:// to enable all browsers)

Deploy client - pack JS files
===============================

To improve the loading behaviour, pack all Js files into one and only load that one. see gamejs/docs/deployment for more info.

    gamejs/wrap-directory.sh ../banditracer-client/javascript/

.. then fix banditracer's index.html to use the single, big file.

Map Editor
===============

requires:

  * python 2.5+
  * wxPython
  * PIL
  * simple json

    $ python editor.py

You can select objects with left mouse button and delete them with
delete key, use mousewheel to rotate props / car starting positions
before placing them. Tiles are not rotatable.

Server
========

Recommended directory layout for checking out both banditracer and the gamejs
repo (so that relative symlinks):

    ~/br/
    ~/br/banditracer-client/
    ~/br/banditracer-server/
    ~/br/gamejs/

For the server, you need http://RingoJs.org

ringo ~/br/banditracer-server/ringomain.js
